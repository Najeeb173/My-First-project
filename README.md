This project is a Decentralized Auction Smart Contract developed using Solidity on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows an Auctioneer to start, run, cancel, or end an auction securely without relying on any centralized platform. Users can place bids using Ether, and the contract ensures fair competition by enforcing a minimum bid increment and maintaining the highest payable bid for transparency. To prevent fraud, the Auctioneer is restricted from bidding, and all participants’ funds are stored safely in the contract until the auction is finalized. When the auction ends or gets cancelled, the smart contract automatically handles payouts: the Auctioneer receives the highest payable amount, while other bidders can withdraw their unused funds. The contract is designed with multiple security checks, custom modifiers, and state management using enums to ensure proper flow and prevent misuse. It demonstrates strong understanding of Solidity concepts such as state variables, mappings, modifiers, require statements, and secure Ether transfer logic. This project highlights the implementation of a real-world decentralized bidding mechanism and showcases proficiency in writing secure and optimized smart contracts.
